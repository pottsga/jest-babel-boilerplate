# Jest Babel Boilerplate

## Summary

Jest doesn't work automatically with ES6 syntax :(. But it does work out-of-the-box with Babel, which allows you to use ES6 syntax with Jest. This project was created to show how that is done simply with just Babel, and without the added complexity of webpack, etc.

## Directions

1. `cd` into the project.
2. `npm install` the dependencies.
3. `npm t` to test your code with Jest.
